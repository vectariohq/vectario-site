# Positioning Notes

Vectario positions itself as a senior engineering partner for teams that cannot afford failure.

Key themes:

- Experience over experimentation
- Clarity over buzzwords
- Ownership over dependency

Primary message:
We help teams design and deliver systems that scale and endure.

Secondary message:
We can build it, maintain it, or hand it off cleanly to your team.
