## Email body (plain text)

Hi <First name>,

I came across <company> and saw that you’re early in the build stage. That’s an exciting but demanding place to be — especially when you’re trying to get things right without over-engineering or over-spending. We’re also in the early stages of building Vectario, after years of working in complex production environments.

We design, build, deploy, and maintain software and cloud systems. Just as often, we deliver clean, maintainable code that clients can fully own — or we can operate and maintain together. Clients get the same dashboards and operational visibility we use ourselves, so there’s no black box and no surprises.

Startup costs can be heavy, so we scope and price work based on the problem at hand. Small, focused engagements are treated as such. No lock-in, and no junior learning curve.

We’re a small, tight-knit group of experienced engineers and cloud architects — not an AI-only coding shop. We use modern tools where they help, but everything we deliver is production-grade and owned end-to-end.

If it’s useful, I’m happy to answer questions or do a quick call. There’s no sales pitch and no pressure — a reply isn’t a commitment in any way.

Best,  
Brad
