# Outreach Plan

## Objective
Generate the first 1–3 paying clients, validate messaging, and establish a repeatable outreach motion that can be scaled or partially automated later.

This plan is intentionally execution-focused. Strategy lives here; individual tasks are promoted into GitHub Projects only when they are concrete and ready to execute.

---

## Current Status
- Outreach email has **not** been written yet
- Outreach plan is now complete enough to create GitHub Project work items
- Next execution step is drafting the initial outreach email (v1)

---

## Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP)

### Primary ICP (Fastest Path to Revenue)
- Newly formed companies (30–180 days old)
- Solo founders or very small teams
- No in-house senior engineer
- Need something live quickly (website, app, cloud foundation)

### Secondary ICP (Higher Value)
- Healthcare, medical, or financial organizations
- Small internal teams blocked on architecture, data, or cloud
- Regulated or data-sensitive environments
- Need senior-level guidance without a full-time hire

---

## Core Value Proposition (Outreach-Friendly)
- Senior engineering help — with or without long-term commitment
- Build, operate, and maintain systems with full dashboards and operational insights
- Clients receive the same monitoring, metrics, and visibility we use ourselves
- Full lifecycle delivery: design → build → deploy → operate
- Event-driven and user-driven cloud-native systems
- Transparent scope, communication, and clean handoff when desired

---

## Outreach Channels

### 1. New Business Discovery (Primary)
Goal: Contact businesses before they already have a vendor.

Potential sources (initial focus):
- **Texas Secretary of State (SOSDirect)** – recent business entity filings and certificates of formation
- **Florida Division of Corporations (Sunbiz)** – newly registered corporations and LLCs
- Recently registered domains (cross‑check against TX / FL entities)
- Newly launched or placeholder business websites

Initial approach:
- Manual discovery to validate signal quality
- Capture company name, date formed, industry, contact email, website status
- Geography is flexible; prioritize signal quality over location

Initial states (Phase 1):
- **Texas (TX)** — strong new business formation, broad industry mix, lower vendor saturation than major coastal tech hubs
- **Florida (FL)** — high entrepreneurial activity, fast business formation, strong early‑stage signal

California and other states remain valid but are deferred until Phase 2 to reduce competitive noise.

### Custom Discovery Project (Planned)
We will build a small, internal discovery tool to identify newly formed or underserved businesses earlier than competitors.

Initial scope:
- Pull newly registered businesses (manual or scripted)
- Enrich with basic signals (industry, website present or not, tech maturity)
- Rank prospects by urgency and fit

Phase 1 will be manual + lightweight scripting.
Phase 2 may include automation and AI-assisted prioritization once signal quality is proven.

### 2. Direct Email Outreach
- Founder / owner email where possible
- Short, senior, non-salesy messages
- Focus on removing risk, not selling features

### 3. LinkedIn (Secondary)
- Connect first, short personalized note
- Follow up only if connection is accepted
- No mass automation initially

### 4. Referrals
- Quietly inform trusted contacts that Vectario is live
- Ask for introductions only when there is a clear fit

## Outreach Execution Principles

### Manual First (Critical)
Initial outreach will be sent manually, not automated.

Rationale:
- Early learning matters more than volume
- Manual sending improves targeting and personalization quality
- Responses (or lack of response) are easier to interpret
- Automation too early amplifies the wrong list or message

Automation is explicitly deferred until messaging and targeting are validated with real replies.

---

## Messaging Themes (Use Consistently)
- “Senior help to get you live correctly the first time”
- “We can build it, run it, or hand it off cleanly”
- “No lock-in, no junior learning curve”
- “Built for growth, compliance, and maintainability”

Avoid:
- Buzzwords
- Over-promising speed
- Sounding like an agency or body shop

---

## Outreach Assets to Create

### Required (Before Sending)
- Outreach email v1 (plain text)
- LinkedIn connection message v1
- One-paragraph “what we do” explanation
- Clear homepage with credibility signals

### Optional (Later)
- Simple 1-page PDF overview
- Short case-style writeups (even hypothetical)

---

## Action Items (Draft → Promote to GitHub)

### Foundation (One-Time Setup)
- Create GitHub Project for outreach execution
- Define columns: Backlog, This Week, In Progress, Blocked, Done
- Decide where outreach tracking notes live (repo doc or simple sheet)

### Discovery
- Pull newly formed businesses from TX and FL official registries (last 30–180 days)
- Enrich records with website, domain, and basic tech‑maturity signals
- Categorize by industry and urgency signal

### Messaging
- Draft outreach email v1
- Draft LinkedIn message v1
- Write 3 subject line variants
- Draft outreach email v1 (explicit build / operate / dashboards / handoff message)

### Calibration
- Send first outreach batch manually (5 prospects)
- Review replies, objections, and confusion points
- Adjust targeting or messaging if needed before increasing volume

### Execution
- Send first outreach batch to 5 prospects (manual)
- Do not automate email at this stage
- Track responses manually (spreadsheet or notes)
- Send follow-up to non-responders on Day 7

### Validation
- Note objections, questions, and responses
- Identify which industries respond fastest
- Adjust messaging after first 10 contacts

---

## Metrics to Track (Lightweight)
- Emails sent
- Response rate
- Calls booked
- Paid engagements
- Time-to-first-response

---

## Promotion Rules (Important)
Only create GitHub Project items when:
- The task is specific
- The task can be completed in ≤1–2 sittings
- Success criteria are clear

Examples:
- “Draft outreach email v1”
- “Send outreach to 5 new businesses”
- “Follow up with non-responders (Day 7)”

---

## Automation Guidelines (Later Phase)

Automation is considered only when:
- At least 15–20 outreach emails have been sent manually
- Replies have been received (positive or negative)
- Common objections and questions are understood
- Target profiles feel repeatable

At that point, automation should remain lightweight and reversible.

## Notes
This plan incorporates lessons from rapid website and services businesses that focus on early discovery of new companies.

The competitive advantage is timing, clarity, and senior execution — not volume outreach.

This document is considered “ready for execution.” Updates should be driven by real responses, not speculation.
